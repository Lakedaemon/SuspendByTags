This plugin allows you to suspend all cards (stop) or all new cards (pause) 
that have the following tags (it's best to set that in the model tags) :

French: "french" or "français"
Maths: "math" or "maths" or "mathematics" or "mathématiques"
English: "english" or "anglais"
Physics: "physics" or "physique"
SI: "si"

I initially wrote this plugin for my students but it might be usefull for other stuff 
(I'm planning to integrate this in JxPlugin for japanese anyway)
